I'm learning and practing AI tech by study the source codes of ggml(or ncnn) as an independent programmer although parts of them(the real/hardcore AI tech) are really hard to understand quickly. This is not the most important difficult problem for this project.


The most important difficult problem for this project is the big interference of GFW: a paid proxy must be used for reliable access to github.com and huggingface.

The cost of purchase a paid proxy is really not cheap for an independent programmer(the LLM models is so big and I have to downgrade the bandwidth of proxy after complete downloading the LLM models, of course, open/close the paid proxy on demand is essential for purpose of costdown).
