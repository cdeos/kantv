. Should I use/reference kantv in my project?

Project KanTV is a personal/hobby project. It does not strive to provide a production ready implementation. The main goals of the implementation is to be educational, hackable. There are no guarantees that the implementation is correct and bug-free and stuff can break at any point in the future. Support and updates will depend mostly on contributions, since with time I will move on and won't dedicate too much time on the project.

If you plan to use kantv in your own project, keep in mind the above.

My advice is to not put all your eggs into the kantv basket although I wish you could feed your need by use/reference this project.


. Is there any IPR concern/risk in kantv?

Project KanTV was almost/completely done by myself since 05-2021 and NO IPR concern/risk(some parts with IPR risk(implementation of ChinaDRM, widevine, wiseplay, TA side of TEE...) have been removed accordingly because I had been received good IPR compliance training in MNC company).



. Can I sponsor to project KanTV

In Sep 2022, after I left my last employer(a branch of an American IT company in Beijing), I became a no-paid/freelancer programmer because of various/complex reason. started writing some code for solving some technical problems in a personal project KanTV(which was launched on 05/2021) and also for practicing my C/C++/Java programming. Just for fun, I implemented online-TV recording feature on 12/2023, I implmented a <a href="https://github.com/zhouwg/kantv/issues/64">device-side AI PoC on Xiaomi 14</a> by the great&excellent&amazaing <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp">whisper.cpp</a> on 03/2024 - something I did not expect at all.

I have to say I heard whisper.cpp too late.if there is no GFW, I would heard Georgi Gerganov's great whisper.cpp earlier.of course there are many programmers and AI researchers from China heard wishiper.cpp very earlier, this is also the fact(I had been spent about RMB10000(USD 1500-1600) to fix network issue caused by GFW since 2019).

With personal time/effort(personal purchase a Dell PC and Xiaomi 14 for software development activity, personal purchase Cloud Server for setup a dedicated proxy to cross the GFW and then access github more stably and Google is available accordingly......), the project grew and now I want to seek external resource to help this project growing.

I don't have an oversea phone number and I could not create Github Sponsors account accordingly.I only have a Wechat account so I put my personal WeChat reward(aka "赞赏" in Chinese or "donation" in English) QR code here.In other words, sponsorship of this project can ONLY be done through WeChat Pay(it's also to comply China's compliance policy. a TIP here:many personal privacy information(include face identification) might be required/provided to open a WeChat/WeChat Pay account and as well-known we(include Tencent) are used to that because of China's compliance policy) and if you mind that pls ignore this sponsorship info), thanks for your understanding.

Still, if you do decide to sponsor me, the money will most likely go towards buying [various high-end powerful Android phone](./docs/high-end-android-phone.md) for device-side AI software development activity and pay for Cloud Server, or buy some coffee or buy a meal to potential volunteer programmer to participate in project's development.

Contribute PR/codes is the best sponsorship to project KanTV.

Thanks!



. What's the relationship between kantv and whisper.cpp


Project KanTV has NO relationship with whisper.cpp but only use source code of whisper.cpp as ASR engine.

But, I have to say that GGML's whisper.cpp is a real excellent and amazing open source AI project and very helpful for C/C++ programmer and the original author of GGML is the only person I know of who is AI expert and modern C++ master and familiar with both iOS(app / native ) and Android(app / native) and Linux(app / native) software development at the same time(I know a few programmers who are familiar with both iOS(app / dev) and Android (app / native) and Linux(app / native) software development but they also know very little about real AI tech) and I have to say that the original author of GGML made a huge contribution to our planet.


. Could I contact to you by e-mail?

- Please do not send e-mail to me for technical/non-technical question. Public technical discussion on github is preferred.
- feel free to submit issues or new features(focus on Android at the moment), volunteer support would be provided if time permits.
