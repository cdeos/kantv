- Should I use/reference kantv in my project?

Project KanTV is a personal project. There are no guarantees that the implementation is correct and bug-free.

The source code of KanTV Android APP has been completely open source. the source code of libkantv-ffmpeg.so has also been completely open source. the <a href="https://github.com/zhouwg/kantv/issues/64">source code of whispercpp-JNI</a> and <a href="https://github.com/zhouwg/kantv/issues/121">source code of Qualcomm's QNN backend of GGML</a> also has been completely open source.

If you plan to use kantv in your own project, keep in mind the above. although I wish you could feed your need by use/reference this project.

- Is there any IPR concern/risk in kantv?

Project KanTV was almost/completely done by myself since 05-2021 and NO IPR concern/risk(some parts with IPR risk(implementation of ChinaDRM, widevine, wiseplay, TEE...) have been removed accordingly because I had been received good IPR compliance training when I was a full-time employee/programmer in MNC IT company).

- Are you good at real/hardcore AI tech?

<b>NO</b>

I know very very very little about real/hard-core AI tech. In short, I'm just an experienced Linux/Android system software programmer(know something about iOS app development) and I'm good at streaming media tech. I'm interested in learning&practicing AI tech in real-scenario on Android device.


- Could I contact to you by e-mail?

  * Please do not send e-mail to me for technical question. Public technical discussion on github is preferred

  * Feel free to submit issues or new features(focus on Android at the moment), volunteer support would be provided if time permits

  * Have fun with the great FFmpeg and the great whisper.cpp and the magic llama.cpp
