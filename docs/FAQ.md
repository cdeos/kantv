- Should I use/reference kantv in my project?

Project KanTV is a personal/hobby project. There are no guarantees that the implementation is correct and bug-free.

If you plan to use kantv in your own project, keep in mind the above. although I wish you could feed your need by use/reference this project.

- Is there any IPR concern/risk in kantv?

Project KanTV was almost/completely done by myself since 05-2021 and NO IPR concern/risk(some parts with IPR risk(implementation of ChinaDRM, widevine, wiseplay, TEE...) have been removed accordingly because I had been received good IPR compliance training when I was a full-time employee in MNC company).

- Are you good at real/hardcore AI tech?

<b>NO</b>

I know very very very little about real/hard-core AI tech. In short, I'm just an ordinary Linux/Android system software programmer(know something about iOS app development) but I'm good at streaming media tech and interested in study&practice AI tech in real-scenario on mobile device(Android or iOS).

<hr>

- Will you open source the source code of libkantv-core.so?

<b>NO</b> or not currently.

The source code of KanTV Android APP has been completely open source, and the source code of libkantv-ffmpeg.so has also been completely open source. the <a href="https://github.com/zhouwg/kantv/issues/64">source code of whispercpp-JNI</a> also has been completely open source.


One year later(on 03-23-2024), I read an article from <a href="https://changelog.com/podcast/532">https://changelog.com/podcast/532</a>

A few days ago, I didn't understand/have no idea why Georgi Gerganov open source such a powerful whisper.cpp and all these iOS/Android app are free. After reading this article, I think I understand a little bit：I think it’s because he doesn’t have the pressure to survive in EU, so he can freely develop his hobbies and share them.

I'd like to say that Georgi Gerganov is a real great genius programmer. just my personal thoughts, this could/should/might NOT be happend in my country:

<ul>
<li>
    English is the first barrier
</li>
<li>
    The second is the powerful GFW
</li>
<li>
    The third is that in my country, people need to participate in heavily competition in order to survive, open source such a powerful whisper.cpp is equal to QUIT...... obviously, I don’t want to quit the IT industry completely currently.

</li>
</ul>

- Could I contact to you by e-mail?

  * Please do not send e-mail to me for technical question. Public technical discussion on github is preferred.

  * Feel free to submit issues or new features(focus on Android at the moment), volunteer support would be provided if time permits

- Can I sponsor to project KanTV

I don't have an oversea phone number and I could not create Github Sponsors account accordingly.I only have a Wechat account so I put my personal WeChat reward(aka "赞赏" in Chinese or "donation" in English) QR code here.In other words, sponsorship of this project can ONLY be done through WeChat Pay(it's also to comply China's compliance policy. a TIP here:many personal privacy information(include face identification) might be required/provided to open a WeChat/WeChat Pay account and as well-known we(include Tencent) are used to that because of China's compliance policy) and if you mind that pls ignore this sponsorship info), thanks for your understanding. Of course,I will list received sponsorship and usage of sponsorship irregularly <b>if</b> there is.

![zhouwg-reward](https://github.com/zhouwg/kantv/assets/6889919/7832ef0e-1091-4a82-8f3a-eb78afae500b)

Still, if you do decide to sponsor me, the money will most likely go towards buying [various high-end powerful Android phone](https://github.com/zhouwg/kantv/blob/master/docs/high-end-android-phone.md) for device-side AI software development activity and pay for Cloud Server, or buy some coffee or buy a meal to potential volunteer programmer to participate in project's development.

Contribute PR/codes is the best sponsorship to project KanTV.Thanks.


Have fun with the great FFmpeg and the great whisper.cpp and the great llama.cpp
