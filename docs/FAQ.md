- Should I use/reference kantv in my project?

Project KanTV is a personal/hobby project. There are no guarantees that the implementation is correct and bug-free.

If you plan to use kantv in your own project, keep in mind the above. although I wish you could feed your need by use/reference this project.

- Is there any IPR concern/risk in kantv?

Project KanTV was almost/completely done by myself since 05-2021 and NO IPR concern/risk(some parts with IPR risk(implementation of ChinaDRM, widevine, wiseplay, TEE...) have been removed accordingly because I had been received good IPR compliance training when I was a full-time employee in MNC company).

- Are you good at real/hardcore AI tech?

<b>NO</b>

I know very very very very very very little about real/hard-core AI tech. In short, I'm just an experienced Linux/Android system software programmer(know something about iOS app development) and I'm good at streaming media tech and very interested in study&practice AI tech in real-scenario on mobile device(Android or iOS).

- Will you open source the source code of libkantv-core.so?

<b>NO</b>

The source code of KanTV Android APP has been completely open source, and the source code of libkantv-ffmpeg.so has also been completely open source. the <a href="https://github.com/zhouwg/kantv/issues/64">source code of whispercpp-JNI</a> also has been completely open source.


One year later(on 03-23-2024), I read an article from <a href="https://changelog.com/podcast/532">https://changelog.com/podcast/532</a>

A few days ago, I didn't understand/have no idea why Georgi Gerganov open sourced such a powerful whisper.cpp and all these iOS/Android app are free. After reading this article, I think I understand a little bit：I think it’s because he doesn’t have the pressure to survive in EU, so he can freely develop his hobbies and share them(if I also didn't have any life pressure, I would not hesitate to open source the libkantv-core.so).

I have to say that I was touched with/motivated by the great open source AI project Whisper.cpp from 03-05-2024 to 03-22-2024 after experienced hard time since 01-28-2024.

I'd like to say that Georgi Gerganov is a real great genius programmer. just my personal thoughts, this could/should/might NOT be happend in my country:

<ul>
<li>
    English is the first barrier
</li>
<li>
    The second is the powerful GFW(I had been spent about RMB10000(about USD1600) in the past few years to fix network issue caused by GFW)
</li>
<li>
    The third is that in my country, people need to participate in heavily competition in order to survive, open source such a powerful whisper.cpp is equal to QUIT...... obviously, I don’t want to quit the IT industry completely currently.

</li>
</ul>
