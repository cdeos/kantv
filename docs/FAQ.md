- Should I use/reference kantv in my project?

Project KanTV is a personal/hobby project. There are no guarantees that the implementation is correct and bug-free.

If you plan to use kantv in your own project, keep in mind the above. although I wish you could feed your need by use/reference this project.

- Is there any IPR concern/risk in kantv?

Project KanTV was almost/completely done by myself since 05-2021 and NO IPR concern/risk(some parts with IPR risk(implementation of ChinaDRM, widevine, wiseplay, TEE...) have been removed accordingly because I had been received good IPR compliance training when I was a full-time employee in MNC company).

- Are you good at real/hardcore AI tech?

<b>NO</b>

I know very very very little about real/hard-core AI tech because I majored in economics at university and all computer-related knowledge was fully self-taught by library(I'm very poor at that time and I couldn't afford a PC). of course, I have not studied advanced mathematics or signal theory.

The original author of whisper.cpp and llama.cpp is a real great genius programmer, but I'm just an ordinary Linux/Android system software programmer but I'm good at multimedia/streaming media tech.

- What's the relationship between kantv and GGML

Project KanTV has NO or NO personal relationship with GGML but use source code of whisper.cpp as ASR engine or llama.cpp as LLM engine since 03-05-2024.

I heard whisper.cpp on Jan 2024 at the first time and just use it generate subtitle for original English short video which referenced in Chinese articles on personal WeChat public account, but I didn’t read the source code of whisper.cpp at that time. sadly, my personal WeChat public account was forcefully closed on 01-28-2024. after that, I [decided to migrate some personal software project to Github since 02-22-2024](https://github.com/zhouwg/kantv/blob/master/release/README.md#L122). I have to say that I really spent much time/efforts on personal WeChat public account for public interests or my country's interests before 02-22-2024.

I have to say that life is like a box of chocolate, you never know what you’re going to get. I decided to start integrating the great whisper.cpp to this project since 03-05-2024 and I did it on 03-16-2024 finally. I have to say that I was touched with and motivated by the great open-source project whisper.cpp from 03-05-2024 to 03-22-2024.

At the same time, I have to say that GGML's whisper.cpp is a real excellent and amazing open source AI project and very helpful for C/C++ programmer and the original author of GGML is the only person I know of who is AI expert and modern C++ master and familiar with both iOS(app / native ) and Android(app / native) and Linux(app / native) software development at the same time(I know a few programmers who are familiar with both iOS(app / dev) and Android (app / native) and Linux(app / native) software development but they also know very little about real AI tech) and I have to say that the original author of GGML made a huge contribution to our planet.

- Will you open source the source code of libkantv-core.so?

<b>NO</b> or not currently

The source code of KanTV Android APP has been completely open source, and the source code of libkantv-ffmpeg.so has also been completely open source. the <a href="https://github.com/zhouwg/kantv/issues/64">source code of whispercpp-JNI</a> also has been completely open source.


One year later(on 03-23-2024), I read an article from <a href="https://changelog.com/podcast/532">https://changelog.com/podcast/532</a>

A few days ago, I didn't understand why Georgi Gerganov open source such a powerful whisper.cpp and all these iOS/Android app are free. After reading this article, I think I understand a little bit. I want to / have to say that Georgi Gerganov is a real great genius programmer. just my personal thoughts, this could/should/might NOT be happend in my country:

<ul>
<li>
    English is the first barrier
</li>
<li>
    Then the powerful GFW
</li>
<li>
    The third is that in my country, people need to participate in heavily competition in order to survive, open source such a powerful whisper.cpp is equal to QUIT......

    I'm still looking for new job opportunities and don't want to quit the IT industry completely yet.
</li>
</ul>

- Could I contact to you by e-mail?

  * Please do not send e-mail to me for technical question. Public technical discussion on github is preferred.

  * Feel free to submit issues or new features(focus on Android at the moment), volunteer support would be provided if time permits

    The official webserver of <a href="http://www.cde-os.com/">www.cde-os.com</a> has migrated/redirected to Github Pages and the original e-mail server(a highly customized Qmail-based mail server) was terminated accordingly due to various reasons and no longer maintained since 03-22-2024. at the same time, cdeos-org in Github was closed accordingly.

- Can I sponsor to project KanTV

In Sep 2022, after I left my last employer, I became a no-paid/freelancer programmer because of various/complex reason. started writing some code for solving some technical problems in a personal project KanTV(which was launched on 05/2021) and also for practicing my C/C++/Java programming. Just for fun, I implemented online-TV recording feature for Android phone on 12/2023, I implmented a <a href="https://github.com/zhouwg/kantv/issues/64">device-side AI PoC on Xiaomi 14</a> by the great&excellent&amazaing <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp">whisper.cpp</a> on 03/2024 - something I did not expect at all.

I have to say I heard whisper.cpp too late.if there is no GFW(I had been spent about RMB10000( ~= USD 1400) to fix network issue caused by GFW since 2019), I would heard Georgi Gerganov's great whisper.cpp earlier.of course there are many programmers and AI researchers from China heard wishiper.cpp very earlier, this is also the fact.

Any programmer from Mainland China whom see this comment shouldn't misunderstand above sentence because I really have NO negative thoughts of my great country because I think I'm familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Ming_dynasty">History of the Ming dynasty</a> and I understand running a big&complex country is not easy. BUT, I also don't like GFW at the same time because I respect the fact.

With personal time/effort(personal purchase a Dell PC on May 2021(about RMB12000 ~= USD 1700) and Xiaomi 14 on Feb 2024 for software development activity, personal purchase Cloud Server for setup a dedicated proxy to cross the GFW and then access github more stably and Google is available accordingly......), the project grew and I'm glad to see external resource to help this project growing(although I did <b>NOT</b> have much expectation because I <b>saw</b> the situation of the <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov">great whisper.cpp&ggml</a> and I understand the real-world).

I don't have an oversea phone number and I could not create Github Sponsors account accordingly.I only have a Wechat account so I put my personal WeChat reward(aka "赞赏" in Chinese or "donation" in English) QR code here.In other words, sponsorship of this project can ONLY be done through WeChat Pay(it's also to comply China's compliance policy. a TIP here:many personal privacy information(include face identification) might be required/provided to open a WeChat/WeChat Pay account and as well-known we(include Tencent) are used to that because of China's compliance policy) and if you mind that pls ignore this sponsorship info), thanks for your understanding. Of course,I will list received sponsorship and usage of sponsorship irregularly <b>if</b> there is.

![zhouwg-reward](https://github.com/zhouwg/kantv/assets/6889919/7832ef0e-1091-4a82-8f3a-eb78afae500b)

Still, if you do decide to sponsor me, the money will most likely go towards buying [various high-end powerful Android phone](https://github.com/zhouwg/kantv/blob/master/docs/high-end-android-phone.md) for device-side AI software development activity and pay for Cloud Server, or buy some coffee or buy a meal to potential volunteer programmer to participate in project's development.

Contribute PR/codes is the best sponsorship to project KanTV.Thanks.


Have fun with the great FFmpeg and the great whisper.cpp
