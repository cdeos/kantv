Changes since the last public release (1.2.57):

version 1.2.58 [August 24, 2017]
  Added png_check_chunk_length() function, and check all chunks except
    IDAT against the default 8MB limit; check IDAT against the maximum
    size computed from IHDR parameters.
  Check for 0 return from png_get_rowbytes() and added some (size_t) typecasts
    in contrib/pngminus/*.c to stop some Coverity issues (162705, 162706,
    and 162707).
